# Block2Project

This repository made as an exercise in copyright.

This repository contains several simple scripts. One for bayesian calculations, one for student loan calculations, and one for a game of connect 4. Note that the scripts are not production ready by any means and are meant as foundations from which the scripts can be adapted to your needs. 

In the future, this repository will hold numerous utility scripts, all of which will fit the theme of simple scripts. You are free to take these scripts and use them to make your life or projects easier.
